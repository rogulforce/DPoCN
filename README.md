Reffering to the message below, we've decided to work together on list 5 and 6 on.

"I have no problem if you want to work in pairs 
To be honest, I prefer when you work in pairs because each of you can brings something to that work during brainstorming and you can share your best skills and validate the list with each other
and during marking your 3rd list I saw that some of you consults the list anyway as solutions were similar (or the way of thinking)

Please react if you read it 👍 👏 🔥 💯 👀 ☺️ ......

and You can always contact me directly if you need help in solution, you have problem because personal issues/health,  or you need additional term for submisions"
